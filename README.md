#ParelPracht
ParelPracht is the successor of Goudglans, the custom Customer Relation Management system of Study Association GEWIS.
This new system is built during the second lockdown of the corona pandemic.
Its main goal is to automate tedious tasks and to keep a clear and concise overview of the current collaborations.
This is achieved by creating nice structured insights tables and graphs and automating the generation of contracts, proposals and invoices.

This is the front-end of ParelPracht. [The back-end can be found here](https://github.com/GEWIS/parelpracht-server).

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run start`. This runs the client in development mode. You can view it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can also build the application with `npm run build`. This puts a production build in the `./build` directory.

## Deployment
